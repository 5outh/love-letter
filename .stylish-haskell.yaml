# stylish-haskell configuration file
# ==================================

# The stylish-haskell tool is mainly configured by specifying steps. These steps
# are a list, so they have an order, and one specific step may appear more than
# once (if needed). Each file is processed by these steps in the given order.
steps:
  # Convert some ASCII sequences to their Unicode equivalents. This is disabled
  # by default.
  # - unicode_syntax:
  #     # In order to make this work, we also need to insert the UnicodeSyntax
  #     # language pragma. If this flag is set to true, we insert it when it's
  #     # not already present. You may want to disable it if you configure
  #     # language extensions using some other method than pragmas. Default:
  #     # true.
  #     add_language_pragma: true

  # Align the right hand side of some elements.  This is quite conservative
  # and only applies to statements where each element occupies a single
  # line.
  - simple_align:
      cases: true
      top_level_patterns: true
      records: true

  # Import cleanup
  - imports:
      # There are different ways we can align names and lists.
      #
      # - global: Align the import names and import list throughout the entire
      #   file.
      #
      # - file: Like global, but don't add padding when there are no qualified
      #   imports in the file.
      #
      # - group: Only align the imports per group (a group is formed by adjacent
      #   import lines).
      #
      # - none: Do not perform any alignment.
      #
      # Default: global.
      align: global
      list_align: after_alias
      long_list_align: inline

      # Align empty list (importing instances)
      #
      # Empty list align has following options
      #
      # - inherit: inherit list_align setting
      #
      # - right_after: () is right after the module name:
      #
      #   > import Vector.Instances ()
      #
      # Default: inherit
      empty_list_align: inherit
      list_padding: 4
      separate_lists: true

  # Language pragmas
  - language_pragmas:
      style: vertical
      align: true
      remove_redundant: true

  # Remove trailing whitespace
  - trailing_whitespace: {}

# A common setting is the number of columns (parts of) code will be wrapped
# to. Different steps take this into account. Default: 80.
columns: 80

newline: native

language_extensions:
  - RecordWildCards
  - LambdaCase
  - TemplateHaskell
